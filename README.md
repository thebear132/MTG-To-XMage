# MTG-To-XMage
A script to download your decks from Moxfield, MtgGoldfish, Archideckt and Tappedout to the XMage format ready to play!

### Usage
```
$ git clone https://github.com/thebear132/MTG-To-XMage
$ cd MTG-To-XMage
$ python program.py -moxfield thebear132
```
When you have run the program once with your usernames, they will be saved in `config.json` for next time, so that any time in the future you only have to run
```
$ python program.py
```
Or double click either `Run program (windows).bat` if you use Windows or `Run program (linux).desktop` if Linux

If in doubt, see a list of parameters that can be suppled when running the script
```
$ python program.py --help
```


### Issues
~~Currently Moxfield decks cant be downloaded due to them disallowed "scraping"...~~ (Has been fixed, works with Moxfield again!)
